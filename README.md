# Laser-Distance-sensor-python

Make a distance sensor using any webcam, laser and python. We fix the webcam and laser onto a frame, then program the webcam to pick up the laser. We then calibrate it to understand what the position of the laser will be at different distances. Finally, we reverse this to give us the distance using the laser position.
I've made a youtube video which covers the fundamentals of both progams, although it may not be comprehendible if you don't have experience programming in python.
